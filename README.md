## About This Fork

This fork was created by Juri Valkiainen as part of fullstack software development studies at Careeria.

I was responsible for designing and developing part of the user interface. I implemented the following pages:  
`ExcursionDetail.jsx`, `ExcursionList.jsx`, `GuideDashboard.jsx`, `GuideLogin.jsx`, `GuideRegister.jsx`, `GuideSupport.jsx`,  
as well as UI components:  
`CitySelection.jsx`, `Contact.jsx`, `ExcursionTypes.jsx`, `GuideDropdown.jsx`, `HeroImage.jsx`, `Newsletter.jsx`.

This project demonstrated my skills in teamwork, frontend development, and working with a modern tech stack (React, Node.js, TypeScript, Azure SQL).
